WellGood Coffee Roasters is an up-and-coming roastery that have approached me to create a website to showcase their brand and all they have to offer. It is their platform to sell their retail coffee, equipment as well as offer their customers a place to order their coffee just the way they like it.
Their mission is to get a more wide-spread client base, offering delivery to all of the UK.
They specialise in roasting limited edition retail bags of coffee, which works perfectly for their coffee fanatic customers who can choose their favourite coffee notes and get a new bag to try every time they purchase.
They want to inspire their customers to start their real coffee adventure, explore and find a new hobby in doing so, just like they have.

I have created this as my fourth milestone project for the Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

### User Journey
I created UX flow charts using FigJam to map out the user stories.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
I used Coolor to choose a hipster-vibe colour palette for the site. Once chosen, I then checked colour combinations of the palette through the contrast checker to make sure the readability of my site was at a high standard and that I was followed good practices for accessibility.

<img src="media/readme-images/colour-palette-ms4.png" alt="Screen mockup of WellGood Coffee">


#### Colour Accessibility
			
I checked the contrast on any colour combinations I intended to use from my palette with [Coolor contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker) to determine if they met the [WCAG AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

The dark blue and black and good readability. I tested the red to see if that would be acceptable for text use, but the contrast was not high enough so this along with the other colour in the colour palette will just be used for accents where needed.

![Contrast checker](media/readme-images/contrast-checker.png)

#### Typography
I chose a cursive font for titles, 'Playwrite IE' and 'Mulish' a simple sans-serif for the body text that is easy to read. I wanted to ensure I maintained good readability, which in turn will give an overall better user experience.

#### Imagery

  - ##### Logo
    I created the logo myself using the main title font 'Playwrite IE' and designing the logo in Adobe Illustrator.
    ![WellGood Coffee logo](media/readme-images/wellgood-logo.png)

  - ##### Background images
    I used two images for backgrounds on the home page and about page, which I sourced from [Pexels.com](pexels.com)




  - #### Product Images
    Equipment product images were also sourced from Pexels, all of the attributions for these images are in the below table. For the coffee bags I used a coffee bag mockup image from Freepik as well and edited to included my artwork in Photoshop.

### Wireframes
The wireframes were creates using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I have deviated somewhat from my original wireframes, but this was mainly design preference and ensuring a good responsive layout on smaller screens.

I did not create separate wireframes for mobile and tablet as the layout is identical.

### Future Features

Given additioanl time and resource some future features that I would like to encorporate into this project are...

- The abilitiy to sign up and sign in using social accounts such as google or facebook.
- To restric reviews so that a personal can only review a product that they have previously purchased
- For the user to be able to store favourite products or a wishlist
- Product recommendations based on previous purchases and also other similar user profiles
- Abdandoned cart recovery
- A loyalty program
- A feature where users can request notification emails when their favourite products come back into stock

### Accessibility
-   The use of semantic HTML.
-   Ensuring the colours and text use meet accessibility standards set by [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
-   Ensuring all clickable buttons and links are tabbable using the keyboard.
-   Using descriptive alt tags on all images.
-   Using correct aria labels where necessary.
-   Being mindful in the creation of the design to ensure it is intuitive and as easy to navigate as possible.

### Development Process
As well as using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create wireframes and flow charts for this project, I also used Figma's Kanban template to keep track of tasks as I found the "sticky note" style more user friendly and it suited my style of task management better.

You can view the Kanban board [here](https://www.figma.com/file/rspHu8qzVH35mFzarGLARC/Keto-Kreations-Kanban?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=CzMSWuqP3I3DBtYb-1).

## Testing

Please see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for all testing performed


## Deployment

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using a free relational database from [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). Before deploying to Heroku I would first set up the database so I will explain the deployment in 2 two parts.

### ElephantSQL

1. Navigate to [ElephantSQL.com](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and click “Get a managed database today”

2. Select “Try now for FREE” in the TINY TURTLE database plan.

3. Select “Log in with GitHub” and authorize ElephantSQL with your selected GitHub account.

4. In the Create new team form:
    - Add a team name (your own name is fine)
    - Read and agree to the Terms of Service
    - Select Yes for GDPR
    - Provide your email address
    - Click “Create Team”

5. Your account should now be successfully created.

6. Click “Create New Instance”.

7. Set up your plan:
    - Give your plan a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)
    - Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan
    - You can leave the Tags field blank

8. Select a data centre closest to you - I used EU-West-1 (Ireland).

9. Click "Review".

10. Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”.

11. Your database should now be successfully created.

12. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.

13. In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard. Keep this tab open as we will need this URL later.

### Heroku

1. To successfully deploy on Heroku we first to install some dependencies to that you can use Postgres on your deployed site. 

    ```bash
    pip3 install dj_database_url
    pip3 install psycopg2
    ```

2. We then need to create some files: a requirements.txt file and a Procfile.

3. The requirements.txt file contains all the applications and dependencies that are required to run the app. To create the requirements.txt file run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

4. The Procfile tells Heroku which files run the app and how to run it. To create the Procfile run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
     web: gunicorn [your app name].wsgi:application
    ```

5. If the Procfile has been created correctly it will have the Heroku logo next to it. It is also important to check the Procfile contents, as sometimes on creation a blank line will be added at the end of the file. This can sometimes cause problems when deploying to Heroku, so if the file contains a blank line at the end, delete this and save the file. Make sure to save both these files and then add, commit and push them to GitHub.

6. Login (or sign up) to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).

7. Click the new button and then click create new app.

8. You will then be asked to give your app a name (these must be unique) and select a region. Once these are completed click create app.

9. You will now need to connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for the site. Select GitHub in the deployment section, find the correct repository for the project and then click connect.

10. Once the repository is connected, you will need to provide Heroku some config variables it needs to build the app. Click on the settings tab and then click reveal config vars button. You will now need to add the environment key/value variables some of which were used in the env.py file and some of which will be different:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | -- | -- |
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `your variable here if you have it already` |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `your variable here if you have it already` |
    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1* |
    | DATABASE_URL | `your variable here`** |
    | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `your variable here` |
    | EMAIL_HOST_USER | `your variable here` |
    | SECRET_KEY | `your variable here` |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `your variable here` |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `your variable here` |
    | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `your variable here` |
    | USE_AWS | True |
    | DEVELOPMENT | True*** |

    *This is temporary and will be removed later.

    **This is where we paste our URL from step 13 in ElephantSQL section.

    ***This variable is to be deleted once debugging is complete and you are ready to deploy your "production" app.

11. You then need to add the hostname of your Heroku app to settings.py which can be found in the Heroku settings tab under Domains.

    ```bash
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['keto-kreations-25ff0a2cbc9e.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```

12. We now need to migrate our database to our ElephantSQL databse. Go to the top right hand of Heroku and select, more then select Run console. Type bash and click Run then type the following commands.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate --plan
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
    
13. Assuming all your migrations were completed succesfully you can now create your superuser by running the below command and filling in your details.

      ```bash
      python3 manage.py createsuperuser    
      ```

14. Now that the relational database has been set up and the tables created and superuser created, we can now click open app and the application should now open in a new tab. If you haven't set up your AWS yet your CSS and images wont have loaded yet. We will set that up next.

### Amazon AWS

  #### Setting up an S3 Bucket
  1. Create an [Amazon AWS](aws.amazon.com) account

  2. Search for **S3** and create a new bucket
      - Allow public access

        }
      ]
      ```

  5. Under **Permissions > Bucket Policy**:
      - Generate Bucket Policy and take note of **Bucket ARN**
      - Chose **S3 Bucket Policy** as Type of Policy
      - For **Principal**, enter `*`
      - Enter **ARN** noted above
      - **Add Statement**
      - **Generate Policy**
      - Copy **Policy JSON Document**
      - Paste policy into **Edit Bucket policy** on the previous tab
      - Save changes

  6. Under **Access Control List (ACL)**:
      - For **Everyone (public access)**, tick **List**
      - Accept that everyone in the world may access the Bucket
      - Save changes

  #### Setting up AWS IAM
  1. From the **IAM dashboard** within AWS, select **User Groups**:
      - Create new group e.g. `manage-keto-kreations`
      - Click through without adding a policy

            "Resource": [
                            "arn:aws:s3:::keto-kreations",
                            "arn:aws:s3:::keto-kreations/*"
                  ]
      ```

      - Click **next step** and go to **Review policy**
      - Give the policy a name e.g. `keto-kreations-policy` and description
      - **Create policy**

  3. Go back to **User Groups** and choose the group created earlier
      - Under **Permissions > Add permissions**, choose **Attach Policies** and select the one just created

      - Click Next and **Create User**

  5. **Download the `.csv` containing the access key and secret access key. This will NOT be available to download again**

  #### Hooking Django up to S3

  1. Install boto3 and django-storages
      ```bash
      pip3 install boto3
      pip3 install django-storages
      pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
      ```

  2. Add the values from the `.csv` you downloaded to your Heroku Config Vars under Settings:
      ```bash
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ```

  3. Delete the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from your Config Vars and deploy your Heroku app, if you have enabled automatic deployment in Heroku this will happen automatically the next push you make to GitHub

  4. With your S3 bucket now set up, you can create a new folder called `media` (at the same level as the newly added `static` folder) and upload any required media files to it, making sure they are publicly accessible under **Permissions**


### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

3. In the top right hand corner of the page locate and click the 'fork' button.
4. Near the bottom of the page click the green button that says 'Create Fork'.
5. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. Near the top of the repository click the green 'Code' button.
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under HTTPS copy the link provided.
5. Open the terminal in your code editor. 
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
8. Press Enter. Your local clone should be created.
